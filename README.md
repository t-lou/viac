# VI(weekly)AC(academy)

Perhaps I am in a developer position, where the current tech trend is very important.

But I'm outside of university and don't have access the state-of-art discussions.

Perhaps once per week, one glimpse of the recent papers would be nice.

Start this script, and the highlights of papers in last week is available.

## config

Being user-friendly is not really the core here, so you still need to explore and configure a bit.

Now, only https://arxiv.org/ is supported. You need to set the code and some keywords.

For the code, first open the website

then navigate to the category which interests. The code is then in the url address. In this case, "cs.CV".

The keywords are parts of the words which interest you. For example, if you like pattern recognition, then
"detect" can be nice, as it will match both "detector" and "detection".
